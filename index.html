The group aims to build a platform for the enthusiasts of civil engineering to strive towards making advancements in Civil Engineering. We became the affiliated with the American Society of Civil Engineering for a while but then decided to part ways and build the Civil Engineering Consortium which would be a combination of a technical and departmental group. <br><br>Every year we recruit 15 members to our group and train them to work in one of the specialities of Civil Engineering and participate in competitions taking place in and around India.</div>
